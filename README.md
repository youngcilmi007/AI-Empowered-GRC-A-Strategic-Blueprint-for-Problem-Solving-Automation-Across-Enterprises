Deliverable (Identified Risks & Proposed Mitigations):

Identified Risks (Table Format) for Data Handling Processes:

Risk ID	Risk Area	Risk Description	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Score	Current Mitigations (if any)
RDP001	Data Privacy	Non-compliance with GDPR/CCPA data retention limits due to lack of automated deletion, leading to excessive data storage.	High	High	High	Manual review processes (inefficient, error-prone)
RDP002	Data Security	Sensitive client project data retained beyond its utility or legal requirement, increasing breach surface area.	Medium	High	High	Standard access controls
RDP003	Operational	Inefficient storage utilization and increased backup costs due to retaining unnecessary historical data.	Medium	Medium	Medium	Limited automated archiving; reliance on manual storage monitoring
RDP004	Data Privacy	Failure to fully delete data upon user request (Right to Erasure) across all systems (including backups), leading to legal/reputational damage.	High	High	High	Basic deletion functions; lack of holistic deletion across interconnected systems
RDP005	Compliance	Inability to demonstrate adherence to SOC 2 "Privacy" and "Confidentiality" principles due to undocumented or inconsistent data retention/deletion practices.	Medium	High	High	Some data classification; no formal, auditable policy enforcement
Proposed Mitigation Strategies:

For RDP001 & RDP002 (Excessive Data Retention & Breach Surface): I propose implementing automated data lifecycle management tools within cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage Lifecycle Management) to automatically transition data to colder storage or delete it based on defined retention policies. Integration with application logic would apply retention tags upon data creation.
For RDP004 (Failure to Delete upon Request): I propose developing and rigorously testing a comprehensive Data Subject Request (DSR) fulfillment process that ensures data deletion across all active and backup systems within defined timelines. This includes mapping all data repositories.
For RDP005 (Lack of Demonstrable Compliance): I propose implementing a centralized GRC management system (e.g., a Google Sheet-based tracking system) to document all data retention policies, risk assessments, and deletion procedures, ensuring clear audit trails.

Strategic AI Tech Integration for Complex Tasks
My Accomplishment: I developed a strategic blueprint for integrating specialized generative AI tools to handle complex GRC tasks like audit log analysis and incident report drafting.

Deliverable (AI Tech Strategy Examples):

GRC Task: Summarization & Analysis of Audit Logs for Anomalies

AI Tool/Type: Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini Pro (via Google Cloud Vertex AI's Generative AI Studio/API).
Execution Strategy: I would feed structured or semi-structured raw audit log data to the LLM with a specific prompt to identify and summarize anomalies (e.g., unusual login times, unauthorized access, mass data downloads), potential policy violations, and indicate security incidents.
Expected Output: Concise, actionable summaries highlighting unusual events, potential risks, affected entities, and timestamps, ready for further investigation.
Integration Idea: The LLM's findings could be automatically added to a "Security Incident Log" Google Sheet via Zapier, triggering alerts or feeding into Google Looker Studio for visual trend analysis.
GRC Task: Automated Drafting of Incident Reports

AI Tool/Type: Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini Pro (via Google Cloud Vertex AI's Generative AI Studio/API), potentially enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
Execution Strategy: I would provide the LLM with key incident details (timestamps, affected systems/users, event summary, initial actions) and a prompt to draft a preliminary security incident report. The report would follow a standard structure, maintaining a formal tone and referencing relevant compliance implications (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2).
Expected Output: A structured draft incident report, including sections like Incident ID, Type, Date/Time Discovered, Affected Assets/Data, Summary of Events, Initial Response Actions, and Next Steps, ready for human review and finalization.
Integration Idea: The generated report draft could be automatically saved as a Google Doc in a designated "Incident Reports" folder in Google Drive, with a link added to an "Incident Management Log" Google Sheet (via Zapier).
